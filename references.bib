   abstract = {The rate at which frames are rendered in a computer game directly impacts player performance, influencing both the game playability and enjoyability. However, despite the importance of frame rate and the wide-spread popularity of computer games, to the best of our knowledge, there is little quantitative understanding of the effects of frame rate on player performance in computer games. This paper provides a unique classification of actions in First Person Shooter (FPS) games based on interaction requirements that allow qualitative assessment of the impact of frame rates on player performance. This qualitative assessment is supported by quantitative analysis from two large user studies that measure the effects of frame rate on the fundamental player actions in a FPS game. Nearly 100 users participated in the two user study experiments, providing performance and perception data over a range of frame rates commonly studied for video streaming and inclusive of frame rates found in many computer game platforms. In general, the analysis shows that actions that require precise, rapid response, such as shooting, are greatly impacted by degradations in frame rates, while actions with lower precision and response requirements, such as moving, are more tolerant of low frame rates. These insights into the effects of frame rates on player performance can guide players in their choice for game settings and new hardware purchases, and inform system designers in their development of new hardware. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {Esports athletes often reduce visual quality to improve latency and frame rate, and increase their in-game performance. While limited research has examined the effects of this visuo-spatial tradeoff on performance, we could find no work studying how widespread this practice is, and how it is done. This paper describes an initial examination of these questions focused on Dota 2, one of the leading esports games. First, we study how athletes manage the visuo-temporal tradeoff in practice by gathering the game configuration data of Dota 2 players in a small survey. We learn that playersdo limit visual detail, particularly by turning off VSYNC, which removes rendering/display synchronization delay but permits visual“tearing”. Second, we study the intent of those same players with a few subjective questions, finding that though there were exceptions,player intent and practice aligned well. While our sampling of Dota 2 players was likely not representative, our survey did reveal suggestive trends that lay the groundwork for future, more rigorous and larger surveys.},

   abstract = {In multiplayer games, players need to coordinate action to succeed. This paper investigates the effect of cognitive styles on performance of dyads engaged in collaborative gaming activities. 24 individuals took part in a mixed methods user-study; they were classified as field dependent (FD) or independent (FI) based on a cognitive style elicitation instrument. Three groups of teams were formed, based on the cognitive style of each team member: FD-FD, FD-FI, FI-FI. We examined performance in terms of game completion time, cognitive load, and player experience. The analysis revealed that FD-FI cognitive style had an effect on the performance and the mental load. We expect the findings to provide useful insight for practitioners and researchers on improving team collaboration in different contexts, such as learning, eSports, and disaster response.},

   abstract = {Video game play is among the most popular forms of entertainment in the world and eSports is a multi-billion dollar industry. Esports gamers, and competitive gamers more broadly, want fast game systems to maximize their chances of winning. In general, the faster the game system, the lower the latency between a player's action and the intended outcome. But how much small reductions in local latencies benefit competitive players is not known. This paper presents results from a 43-person user study that evaluates the impact of system latencies for high-end gaming systems (below 125 ms) on experienced Counter-strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) players. Analysis of the results show pronounced benefits to CS:GO player performance (accuracy and score) for even small reductions in latency, with subjective opinions on Quality of Experience following suit.},

   abstract = {In recent years, researchers and practitioners in the human-computer interaction (HCI) community have placed a lot of focus in developing methods and processes for use in the gaming field. Affective user-centered design (AUCD) plays an important role in the game industry because it promotes emotional and mental communication, hence improving the interaction modes between users and video games. This paper looks at the development of a suitable AUCD guideline to determine if the expressed emotion, semantics, and mental concept of a tangible and intangible video gaming interface are well received by its intended users. Approaching AUCD in video games requires investigating multiple data to obtain a reliable data especially when assessing and interpreting affect and emotion. They present a challenge due to many ambiguities related to affect definition and measuring affective emotion can be very tedious due to its complexity and unpredictability. In this paper, we describe the methods and techniques used to assess affective user-centered design in video games. We also discuss our approaches within the context of existing affective gaming and user-centered design theory and data gathering procedures, including the factors affecting internal and external validity and the data analysis techniques.},

   abstract = {E-sports are popular around the world and has become a full-time profession for an increasing number of players. Specialized keyboards, mice, headphones and gaming workstations have been developed to improve performance and reduce physical discomfort associated with prolonged gaming. Games have special requirements of operation requiring faster and larger movement, greater mouse sensitivity and higher input efficiency of pointing devices like the computer mouse. The rapid and precise movements of the mouse may impact performance and pose challenges to musculoskeletal health. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare muscle activity and performance while gaming with mice that vary in connection type (wired versus wireless) and weight (light versus heavy).},
